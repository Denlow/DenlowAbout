        One of my very favorite things to do is to cook. I actually LOVE chopping onions. Here is one of my hero's, Gordon Ramsay, chopping chives or herbs.

      <h3>Eating</h3>

        I not only love to cook, but I also love to eat. Eating is best with people, and there's nothing quite like cooking a 5 star meal and seeing how impressed the friends are!

      <h3>Music</h3>

      <p>When I was three years old I remember asking my mother if I could try out the violin. I loved to listen to classical music and my first instrument thus became the violin.  23 years later, I still play around with it BUT I have shifted to several more instruments!</p>

      <h3>Vegging Out</h3>
      <p>Sometimes all I want to do is just hang out: Netflix or Hulu and some great food or company. Sometimes its the simple things in life that make the moments from A to B more pleasant.
