    <h1>Dear World...</h1>
    <p>Nothing in life is set: Therefore, live and love your life as if its the only chance you have...</p>
    <p>You can't take care of others if you're not taking care of yourself! However once things are back on track, make sure to give back to others when your heart says to do so.</p>
